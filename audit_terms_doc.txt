Prototype	GDPR Risk (e.g., Personal Data Processing)	Ethical Misuse Risk (e.g., Inaccuracy/Harm)	Bias/Transparency Risk	Legal Liability Risk (e.g., No Scraping/Financial)	Mitigation Steps & Ethical Checks
csv_cleaner.py (Cleans/anonymizes local CSVs)	Low-Medium: If CSVs contain PII (e.g., names), hashing pseudonymizes but users must ensure consent/minimization for GDPR; local processing still requires compliance if EU data.mobidev.biz	Low: Data alterations (e.g., filling 'Unknown') could cause inaccuracies in business use.	Low: Simple rules (duplicates/fill) unlikely biased, but review for fairness.	Low: No scraping; potential liability if mishandled PII leads to breaches.	- Enhance consent prompt: "Confirm GDPR compliance for any PII." 
 - Log all changes for audits. 
 - Disclaimer: "Local only; user responsible for data legality—no liability for misuse."logicmanager.com 
 - Bias Check: Log rules for user review.
inventory_tracker.py (Tracks local inventory CSVs)	Low: Rarely involves PII (e.g., stock items); but if supplier names are personal, minor GDPR data protection by design needed.easa.europa.eu	Low-Medium: False alerts could lead to operational harm (e.g., overstocking).	Low: Threshold rules treat items equally; editable to avoid bias.	Low: No scraping; liability if alerts cause financial loss—disclaim as suggestions.	- Prompt: "Review threshold for fairness/no business harm." 
 - Human oversight note in disclaimer. 
 - Ethical Check: "Transparent logging; user verifies outputs to prevent over-reliance."dariomarkovic.com
report_generator.py (Summarizes local CSVs)	Low-Medium: If summaries include PII aggregates, ensure anonymization; GDPR requires accuracy in processing.alation.com	Medium: Inaccurate reports (e.g., wrong means) could mislead decisions, harming businesses.	Low-Medium: Aggregations (mean/sum) could skew if data biased; fallback to describe() helps.	Low: No scraping; disclaim as "not advice" to avoid liability.	- Add verification log: "Report generated—user must check for errors." 
 - Consent: "Confirm data anonymized and rules fair." 
 - Ethical Check: "Promote review for bias; no warranty on outputs."shopify.com
